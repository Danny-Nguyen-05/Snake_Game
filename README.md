</h1> <br/>

<h2 align="left">
  Overview
</h2> 
Developed a customized version of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame. Implemented various gameplay features to increase complexity, improve user engagement, and provide multiple scoring strategies through specialized snack types. <br/>

## **Installing** <br/>
* If Python is not already installed, download the installer package from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and complete the installation. </br>
* Use the following command in the terminal to install the Pygame library: </br>

``` python
pip install pygame
```

## **Running the application** <br/>
Obtain the source code from the repository and execute the file like any other Python script (.py): </br>

``` python
python Snake_Game-main/main.py
```




## **Key Features:** <br/>
* **Power-ups and Speed Boosts**: Introduced multiple power-ups including speed-boosting snacks, double-points snacks, and time-limited lighting mode to enhance player experience. <br/>
* **Light Mode and Gold Snacks**: Created a unique light mode, where players must activate and navigate within a time limit to collect rare "gold" snacks for bonus points. <br/>
* **Score Tracking and Display**: Incorporated a scoring system with various snack types yielding different points and real-time display updates for an engaging user interface. <br/>
* **Adaptive Snake Growth and Movemen**t: Enhanced snake movement with boundary wrapping and turn-tracking, enabling smooth transitions as the snake grows. <br/>

### **Technologies Used**:
* Python, Pygame, Tkinter for UI and message boxes.

### **Challenges Addressed:** <br/>
* Managed complex game mechanics such as timed snack expiration, conditional speed boost durations, and boundary wrapping for continuous gameplay.
* Developed a scoring and bonus system to maintain player engagement and increase difficulty levels as the game progresses.
